# NieR:Automata PC Savedata Tool
Since NieR will put the Steam account ID in your save file, and check it before loading, it's blocking people from share their save files. 
I build this little tool for change that ID.

# How to use
Before you do anything, backup your save file.
Run this tool, click read, open a save file from your backup, filename should be SlotData_x.dat.
It will read your Steam account ID and display it.
Then click write, select the save file from other people that you want play.
It will write your Steam account ID to it.
Put that modified save file back to your savedata folder.
Ready to go!

Note: you need a imagex.exe put in the same folder contains wim_integrator.exe

# ToDo
